About
-----

This is a backend for workflow (business process) management system. You can create or change several workflows (step by step, workpoint by workpoint) for your own business process dynamically, through any Rails API, not by the code or configuration.

You can assign output filters at each workpoint (conditions which ensure that the task at this step of the workflow is solved). Then just assign workers (your employees) to each workpoint, and run your first business task through it!
